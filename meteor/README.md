This is the first attempt at packaging **summernote** for Meteor.js, the most
popular full-stack JavaScript framework on GitHub (http://meteor.com).

The included test demonstrates that instantiation works. However, more work
may need to be done to further integrate the library - in particular, to make
it work with Meteor's reactivity - for example to auto-save to a collection
transparently after the text changes.
